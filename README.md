# Train Simulation App

## Overview

The Train Simulation App is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to simulate various parameters related to train operations. This application allows users to input and visualize different train parameters, making it a useful tool for educational purposes and engineering simulations.

## Features

- **User -Friendly Interface**: Intuitive layout with easy navigation between different parameter settings.
- **Parameter Input Forms**: Users can input various train parameters such as inertial coefficients, axle numbers, and more.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: The app provides real-time feedback and visualization of the input parameters.
- **Multiple Parameter Categories**: Organizes parameters into categories for better usability.

## Technologies Used

- **Qt Framework**: The application is built using the Qt framework for C++.
- **C++**: The primary programming language used for the application logic.
- **QWidgets**: Utilizes Qt's widget toolkit for creating the GUI.

## Installation
